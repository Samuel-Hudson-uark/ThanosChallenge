This is a simple mod that bans the usage of half of all items in the game.

Thanks to Wand of Sparking on Youtube for the challenge concept.


[h1] The Rules [/h1] 

[list]
	[*]Banned items are selected on world creation
	[*]The banned items cannot be used (cannot be swung, placed, equipped, eaten, used as ammo, etc.)
	[*]You are allowed to [b]craft[/b] using banned items, however some recipies will be made impossible by being unable to place a workbench
	[*]The [url=https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Lihzahrd_Power_Cell]Lihzahrd Power Cell[/url] is never banned, since it is the only item required to beat the game. All other items are technically not required
	[*]Percentage of items that are banned on world creation can be modified in the config (50% by default).
	[*]You can reroll which items are banned by selecting the option in the config, then entering the world.
[/list]

Fun fact: The [url=https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Zenith]Zenith[/url] requires around 38 unique items to craft, and the odds of all of those items being legal is around 1 in 200 billion.

Have fun! :)
