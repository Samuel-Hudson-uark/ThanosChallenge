# The Thanos Challenge

This is a simple mod that bans the usage of half of all items in the game.

Thanks to Wand of Sparking on Youtube for the challenge concept.


# The Rules

* Banned items are selected on world creation
* The banned items cannot be used (cannot be swung, placed, equipped, eaten, used as ammo, etc.)
* You are allowed to **craft** using banned items, however some recipies will be made impossible by being unable to place a workbench
* The [Lihzahrd Power Cell](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Lihzahrd_Power_Cell) is never banned, since it is the only item required to beat the game. All other items are technically not required
* Percentage of items that are banned on world creation can be modified in the config (50% by default). You have to create a new world for this config change to take effect.

Fun fact: The [Zenith](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Zenith) requires around 38 unique items to craft, and the odds of all of those items being legal is around 1 in 200 billion.

Have fun! :)
